# polks-personal-site

Create a simple personal website template with the following:

- A header with a placeholder for a profile image and name
- An "About Me" section with placeholder text 
- A "Projects" or "Experience" section with placeholder content
- A "Contact Me" section with placeholder contact info or a contact form
- A simple, clean design

Use "James Polk" as the name for now. We'll fill in the real content later once I have more info from the user.
